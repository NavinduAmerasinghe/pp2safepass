REAL-TIME ALERT SYSTEM FOR ROAD SAFTEY TO PREVENT ANIMAL_VEHICLE CONFLICTS IN SRILANKA


#Main objective
The study combines knowledge-based case studies and crowd-sourcing to find animal habitats and behaviors based on location. Data collected from News and Weather APIs will be used for geofencing, location-based notifications, ads, and filters through geotargeting and RSS feeds. Image processing is used to identify objects using YOLOv3 technology. Ultrasonic sensors, a microcontroller, the Doppler Effect, and relative velocity calculations are used to segment the signal-to-noise ratio and alert the driver of any nearby animals. Guidelines are established for methods to reduce animal-vehicle collisions and for informing others of the implementation of these methods. Users can also access feedback and insights from others regarding their experiences in similar situations.

#Main Research questions
